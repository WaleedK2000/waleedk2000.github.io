Hi!!
I'm Waleed, i live in Pakistan. This site was created as a test website for my MMDS project. I'll attempt to write a few blogs and achieve high SEO Ranking using various onsite and offsite factors.

This website was written using jekyll and the template used was algore. I hosted this website on gihub pages. [I followed this awesome tutorial to set it all up.]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6AJ9qPPoyc&ab_channel=SpencerPao)

I'm in my 7th semester and i will graduate in June 2023. I'm studing B.S. Computer Science and it has helped me realise my passion for computers and coding. Its been a tough 7 semesters and i hope it has prepared me for the challanges that lie ahead.
