I recently found myself in need of a keyboard as I finally decided to use a desk to work on my laptop. I needed a good keyboard which was durable and also easy to use. So, as anyone in the 21st century would do I searched the internet for my options. A leading online marketplace here in Pakistan is daraz.pk. They have good reputation and have been around since 2012. [According to simiarweb it is ranked as #1 ecommerce platform of Pakistan](https://similarweb.com/top-websites/pakistan/category/e-commerce-and-shopping/)

Something that instantly caught my eyes on daraz.pk was a product that was priced at PKR1,997. Its price was slightly higher than the rest of the products. However, this keyboard had the best reviews of them all. The reviews were overwhelmingly positive and there were a lot of reviews. 
## Purchase Decision
They listing not only offered a keyboard but it also offered a mouse along with a free mouse pad. Furthermore, they keyboard had RGB lighting which is useful in the dark and I think it looks cool. Another prominent feature of this keyboard is that it is spill resistant so it will be able to withstand any accidents. The product was advertised well and [there was even a video showing off the product]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHLWmCyXxs&ab_channel=FunBug). 


There is always doubt when buying products online so I was still skeptical. However, I decided to continue due to the overwhelmingly positive with it being rated 4.6 / 5. It was rated by 1089 users and 891 of them gave it 5 stars. Plus the seller, Funbug, also has a positive seller rating of 92%. These factors increased my confidence in the product and after much deliberating I decided to order it.

## Ordering Process
It stated i would get it on 25th December. Which was only 4 days of shipping time. I generally hate waiting a long time for somthing this is why a major reason why I aviod online shopping. The shipping was the responsibility of daraz as stated on the product page. Daraz has gotten so much better overtime and now have their delivery network all over country. Daraz showed their effienctecy by delivering the product a day earlier, on 24th Dec, then the promised date. "So far so smooth" i thought to myself as i signed for the package and the delivery drive drove off.

Overall, it was a pretty good unboxing experience. Package was packed neatly.  Upon opening the box, you are greeted with a thankyou note which is a nice touch. Also, one thing I noticed is that the mouse on the box is not the same one we get. Regardless, I still liked the mouse Funbug gave with the keyboard.

## Product Review
The keyboard and mouse are simple to use. All you have to do is plug their USB ports in your pc and they should work right away. The keyboard has a nice feel to it. Pressing the keys feels nice to press and are soft but firm. Pulling on the keys they don’t come off easily and are sturdy. I have not experienced any lag nor have I felt that a key didn’t work. 
### Highlights


LED Backlight

The back lights work just as advertised. They start off as red on the left and green in the middle and blue on the right. They are turned on or off by pressing the scroll lock button. They only have on or off function. It would have been nice to have a blinking and/or cycle option. One thing odd i found is that the lights are attached to scroll lock feature. Sometimes some apps disable scroll lock which will prevent you from using the backlight untill your on that application.

The Mouse

The mouse is a decent addition. The clicks feel well and the scroll wheel feels nice. The mouse is accurate and tracks movement pretty decently. The mouse also has led which cycle through colors. Theres no way to stop the cycling or change the pattern. Unfourtunatly, you can't even turn off the led lights. I have to say this mouse does look incredible in person then it does in pictures.
