Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016
Third IT-related legislation of Pakistan was passed by the parliament in 2016. It follows up on Prevention of Electronic Crimes Ordinance, 2007. This act adds provisions to gain access to data if investigation officers are able to satisfy the court. Also, allows the blocking of unlawful online content.

## National Cyber Security Policy 2021

This policy was drafted as a part of digital Pakistan initiative. It was released in 2021 and its aim is to set a course for better security laws. The vision of the policy is for the country to attain continuously improving digital ecosystem which is secure, robust and ensures confidentiality. The policy reviews the cyber security laws and deems them to be ineffective at protecting citizens of Pakistan for online crimes. It then continues on to describe the challenges and risks faced by Pakistan.

This policy is set out to ensure national level corporation between various different government agencies. To improve security of all IT products and create awareness in the country. Furthermore, it aims to train more cyber security professionals. It sets out various principles which must be followed. It then goes on to establish a new committee known as the Cyber Governance Policy Committee and provides an institutional structure for implementation of the policy.

It also lists some actions the stakeholders to should take to ensure active defense. Mandates protection of national critical infrastructure and government information systems. Furthermore, it sets out an information security assurance framework.

## Conclusion

Pakistan as a country seems to be always 10 to 15 years behind the latest trends. Unfortunatly, this is also the case in the cyber security domain. ThinkTanks of pakistan must focus on these latest trends. Then only Pakistan as a nation can move forwards.
