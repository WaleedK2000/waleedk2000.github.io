# HI!!!

I have just finished setting up this website. Now i'm making my first blog. I used jekyll to built this website. Jekyll is a static website generator. [You can get jerkyll from here](https://jekyllrb.com/s). Just follow the steps on their website or watch this [amazing youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6AJ9qPPoyc&ab_channel=SpencerPao) to get started.

### Tools used in this Website
<ul>
    <li>Jerkyll</li>
    <li>Github Pages</li>
    <li>Git</li>
</ul>

## Website Hosting

This website is hosted on github pages and deploys automatically when i push to remote repository. You can even checkout some of my amazing work on github by visiting the repository section. I'll be going throught trying to put up my projects as soon as i get some time.
